# Elixir Exercises

A repo that compiles my exercise of the Elixir.

## Useful commands

Open an interactive shell:

recompile # recompile the project
```

Then you can call modules and methods directly. For example:

```bash
Card.create_deck
```

Generate a document by using

```bash
mix docs
```

Run the tests:

```
